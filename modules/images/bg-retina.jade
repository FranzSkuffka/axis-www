description: "Make sure the image is double the size, pass it halved numbers, and you're in the retina-clear. 
  <div class='tip'>
    <h5>You may not need an extra retina image:</h5>
    <ol>
      <li><a href='https://css-tricks.com/using-svg/'>Use SVGs</a> whenever possible: tiny file-size, fully scalable without losing clarity. Seriously, these things are the best.
      <li>When using JPGs: double the image resolution but crank the compression more than you normally would. This often results in <b>smaller</b> filesize for the @2x image versus the standard image at normal compression. The extra compression isn't noticeable on retina screens, because of the smaller pixels. It also looks great on non-retina screens because of browser resampling. Sounds too good to be true right? <a href='http://codepen.io/dbox/pen/PPmPaW'>See a demo here</a>.
