name: 'ellipsis'
description: "Hyphenation is the better word-break. Itâ€™s locale aware, and inserts the hyphen character at the correct place, when breaking the words. This is especially important in responsive designs. It will save you from a lot of ragged lines. And, no need anymore for clunky & slow Javascript hyphenation fallbacks."
